# Aruan2D

The code I've developed to create my professional website available at [aruan.dev](https://aruan.dev). The backend was made in node.js expecting a MongoDB database through the official driver. The frontend pages are available in EJS with all of the scripting done in pure JavaScript, the page look and feel was achieved through the help of [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/index.html).

More info (written in portuguese) is available at the [project page](https://aruan.dev/dev/project/aruan2d) on my website.

## Resources
* A blog page, with posts sorted by categories and date. These categories are listed on the individual post footer and on the sidebar of the main blog page. The sidebar also features a history where posts are arranged by year and each individual month;
* A dev page, where all projects are ordered by most recent updates. There's also a header with shows all projects listed in alphabetical order and by categories;
* Each individual project available on the dev section features a wiki-styled page with a sidebar listing the project summary, an expandable navigation bar pointing to the different sections commenting on the project history, changes, installation steps and resources;
* A design page, featuring four different categories for showcasing a graphical design portfolio. Some of the sections features a dynamic image gallery for displaying an item in greater details. The art section can expand the thumbnails in a modal for showing the image in a larger size and further information regarding the picture. The video section expands a hidden videoplayer that automatically focus and plays the video with its information (video name, description and date) available below the player;
* An about section for providing further information about the website and its author. Its layout is similar to a blog post, featuring a profile picture as an extra;
* The dashboard behaves as an administrative panel where I can create, edit or delete any blog post, dev project, design item or the about section. Its main page also features details about the website such as the size of uploaded data, statistics regarding each section plotted on charts and security information.
